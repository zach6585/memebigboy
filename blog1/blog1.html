    <h1>Why I code</h1>

    <p1>
      I started coding on a whim my freshman year of college to appease my mom and friends who thought I'd like it. I was fairly certain I would be a math and German double major
      coming in to college, but after doing my first lab in my introduction to programming class, I was hooked. I've always been someone who loves solving puzzles, but more importantly,
      I've loved chaos and absurdism. Once I realized all that I could do with code, I started creating programs that served no actual purpose other than to mildly bother my closest friends
      which, to this day, I still love to do. I also hope to make programs that are actually beneficial, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to antagonize the one's I love (They appreciate it thankfully).
      I'm not exactly certain what I want to do with my degree from college or the certification of completion of this boot camp, but for the moment, I just want to learn(.co) and grow as an individual.

      I also love making absolute nonsense, as is evident by this blog posts images and text choices. It's fun to just mess around and see what moronic things I can make, while also learning how to
      make other, more meaningful things, in the process. The combination of both pure entropy and practicality is what makes me love this field.

      What made me decide to take this class is that I felt like I didn't really know anything about computer science. I'm pretty good at python and have been teaching it for some time, but
      that's about it (I know very little about SML but not enough to actually make anything). I'm really hoping that through this program, I'll be able to learn skills outside of what would have been
      available to me at Wesleyan University, the school I attend. I'm really enjoying what I've been doing through the program so far and I'm excited for what's to come.
